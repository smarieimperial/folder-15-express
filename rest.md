REST
	set of standards on how an API should be set up

	method of POST
		would be for inserting data (creating)

	method of GET
		would be for getting data (reading)

	method of PUT 
		would be for updating data (updating)

	method of DELETE
		would be for deleting data (delete)

you could certainly not use PUT and DELETE and instead use POST but then you're not following these set of standards, and you should.


To do this in express you would use the method over ride package
